This builds a docker image to login as Jenkins user. This is useful when debugging Jenkins job that builds using Jenkins user.
At same directory as Dockerfile, run the following to build the image:
docker build -t <image-name> .

Once the image is build, run the following to start the container:
docker run -it --rm --name <container-name> <iamge-name> /bin/bash
